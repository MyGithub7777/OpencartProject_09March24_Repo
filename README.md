What is Framework?
Framework is systematic and sequential way to write the test scripts for automation testing of the application.
It set some rules and regulation to write test script to achieve test results.
Why to use Framework?
Framework is a structural way for building/automating application which provides
Easy code maintenance
Increase code reusability
Higher code readability
Reduced script maintenance cost
Reduced tests time execution
Reduced human resources
Easy reporting
Components of the Framework?
1.Programming languages: Java + Selenium
2.IDE: Eclipse tool
3.Testing Framework: TestNG
4.WebDriver Manager
5.Apache POI
6.Extent Report

JENKINS:
Jenkins is an open-source automation server.
It is used for the continuous integration/continuous delivery and deployment (CI/CD) of the automation software, which is written in the Java programming language.
Types of Automation Frameworks:
1.Data-Driven framework
2.Keyword-driven framework
3.Hybrid-driven testing framework
1.Data-driven Framework:
As name suggest data driven means executing testcases with the help of test data which is stored in some specific format like table or in excel sheet
2.Keyword-driven Framework:
It is also known as table-driven testing.
In Keyword-driven testing, we use a table format to define keywords or action words for each function or method that we would execute.
3.Hybrid-driven Framework:
hybrid driven framework which is Combination of data+ keyword driven framework.
I was working on the Data Driven framework.
Data driven allows to automate the application using test script which can executed by using all the test data available in table. (Excel)
Also, data driven covering high priority testcases those may be positive or negative test cases.
For scripting we are using maven project,
